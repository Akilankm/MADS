## Prerequisites

Before diving into the "Language Modeling" section, it is recommended to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming language, including data types, control flow, and functions.
- Familiarity with fundamental NLP concepts, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.
  - Tokenization: Understanding how to break down text into smaller units (tokens) for analysis and modeling. This involves techniques like splitting sentences into words or subword units.
  - Stemming and Lemmatization: Knowing how to reduce words to their base or root form. Stemming removes prefixes and suffixes, while lemmatization produces meaningful base words using linguistic knowledge.
  - Part-of-Speech Tagging: Understanding how to label words with their respective parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). This can be done using pre-trained models or rule-based approaches.
- Understanding of probability theory and statistical concepts:
  - Knowledge of probability distributions, such as the Bernoulli, binomial, and multinomial distributions.
  - Understanding of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem.
  - Familiarity with statistical measures like mean, median, and variance.
- Familiarity with neural networks and their training process:
  - Understanding the basic architecture and components of neural networks, including input and output layers, hidden layers, and activation functions.
  - Knowledge of backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks, including concepts like loss functions, gradient descent, and weight updates.
  - Familiarity with common neural network architectures, such as feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Having a solid grasp of these prerequisites will provide a strong foundation for understanding the concepts and techniques involved in language modeling in NLP.

## Language Modeling

In the "Language Modeling" phase of NLP, you will learn about statistical language models and various techniques used to model and understand language. Language modeling plays a crucial role in many NLP tasks and applications.

### Statistical Language Models

- Statistical language models aim to capture the structure and patterns of language by assigning probabilities to sequences of words or phrases.
- N-gram models are a popular technique in statistical language modeling. They estimate the probability of a word based on the previous (n-1) words in a sequence.
  - Example: A trigram model can estimate the likelihood of a word given the two preceding words. For instance, in the sentence "I love natural language," the model can estimate the probability of the next word after "natural language" based on the context.
  - N-gram models can suffer from the sparsity problem when the training data lacks sufficient coverage of all possible word sequences.
- Markov models are another approach to language modeling. They assume that the probability of a word depends only on a limited window of previous words (Markov property).
  - First-order Markov models (bigrams) consider the probability of a word based on the preceding word only.
  - Higher-order Markov models, such as trigrams or higher n-grams, consider a longer context window to estimate word probabilities.

### Neural Language Models

- Neural language models leverage neural networks to learn distributed representations of words or phrases, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships.
- Word2Vec, GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) are popular neural language models.
- Word2Vec uses unsupervised learning to create word embeddings, representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space. It learns embeddings by predicting the context words given a target word or vice versa using neural networks.
- GloVe also generates word embeddings, but it incorporates global co-occurrence statistics of words in a corpus. It leverages matrix factorization techniques to learn word vectors that capture semantic relationships.
- BERT revolutionized NLP tasks by pre-training a deep bidirectional representation of language using transformer networks. It learns to predict missing words in sentences by jointly conditioning on both left and right context. BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Applications of Language Modeling

- Language models have various applications in NLP tasks. They are used in machine translation, speech recognition, text generation, and information retrieval.
- Language models can generate coherent and contextually appropriate text by sampling from the learned probability distributions.
- They also enable applications like auto-complete, spelling correction, and grammar checking by predicting the most likely next word or phrase.
- Furthermore, language models serve as a foundation for tasks like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, question answering, and text summarization.

By understanding language modeling techniques, including statistical models like n-grams and Markov models, as well as neural language models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT, you will have a solid foundation for various NLP tasks and applications.
